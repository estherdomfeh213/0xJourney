## 📝 Writeups & Notes

### Week 1: Introduction to cybersecurity
#### Cyber Crime
Those are the crimes committed on the internet. 
- examples 
1. Identity theft 
2. Online Predators 
3. BEC( Business Email Compromise)
4. Ransomware 
5. Staaling of sensitive intellectual property 
 
- The dark web (also called The Dark Internet) is a network within the internet which is only accessible using certain software and protocols. 

-- Popular examples of the dark web is Tor Network or Onion Router.  
- it is just like the regular browsers, except it addresses ends with .onion instead of .com
for example: Facebook - http://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion. 

#### Networking Basics 
Networking: refers to the process of connecting multiple devices like computers, servers, and mobile devices together to enable the exchange of information and resources through a system of interconnected networks, allowing them to communicate with each other across a network. like the internet. Essentially, it's the practice of creating and managing these connections between devices to facilate data transfer. 

- The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnetion) model represents an easy and intuitive way to standardize the different parts required to communicate across networks. 

- The model makes it clear what is required to communicate on a network by splitting the requirements into multiple layers. 

- The OSI Model looks like this: 

Layer                                                            	What it does
7 - Application	                                         Where humans process data and information
6 - Presentation	                                       Ensures data is in a usable format
5 - Session                                              Capable of maintaining connections
4 - Transport	                                           Data is forwarded to a service capable of handling requests
3 - Network Layer                                        Responsible for which path packets should travel on a network
2 - Data Link	                                           Responsible for which physical devices packets should go to
1 - Physical                                             The physical infrastructure to transport data


### To become a cybersecurity analyst, you need;
1. Soft skills 
2. Cybersecurity Knowledge like Networking, incident responsing 
3. Certifications
